# YouTube Default Title

YouTube Default Title is a browser extension that forces YouTube to load the non-translated title for videos that are not in your default language.

Currently, YouTube offers localization for certain YouTube videos, which can be annoying since the translation isn't always great. This extension replaces the video title with the page title instead.

## Missing features
- Replace title on page nav, not just page load.
- Allow browser action to switch back to translated title.
